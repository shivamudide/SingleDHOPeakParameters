# SingleDHOPeakParameters
We would like to determine the magnitides and widths of both the central Rayleigh peak and the inelastic excitation. We would also like to determine the location of the excitation. We have a full intensity curve at 1203 K as our data.

See Jupyter Notebook for more info and code

Please email cbernal@caltech.edu to inquire about the data file "ie_unnorm_1203K_cooling.dat"
